## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the planning phase for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book" project. This included creating the implementation plan, a research outline, a conceptual data model, a content structure contract, and a quickstart guide.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created the implementation plan, research, data model, content contract, and quickstart guide for the technical book.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, content-structure-contract.md, quickstart.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now proceed with task generation using /sp.tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully guided the user through the planning phase, creating essential design documents despite initial environment limitations (missing pwsh). The plan now provides a solid foundation for implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None (initial pwsh failures were mitigated manually in earlier steps, not during this specific plan command execution).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
