# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. It will be maintained and extended as modules are written.

## A

**Action (ROS 2)**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks with feedback. Actions combine the request-response pattern of services with the continuous data stream of topics.

**ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**: Technology that converts spoken language into text. Examples include OpenAI Whisper and Google Speech-to-Text.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical robot or system that mirrors its behavior in simulation. Used for development, testing, and training before deployment.

## G

**Gazebo**: An open-source physics simulation engine for robotics. Supports realistic physics, sensor simulation, and robot modeling via URDF/SDF.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot designed to resemble and move like a human, typically with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs. Examples include Unitree G1, Boston Dynamics Atlas.

## I

**Isaac ROS**: NVIDIA's ROS 2 packages for perception, navigation, and manipulation. Includes VSLAM, object detection, and other AI-powered pipelines.

**Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's photorealistic robotics simulator built on Omniverse. Provides high-fidelity physics, graphics, and synthetic data generation.

## L

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: AI models trained on vast text corpora that can understand and generate natural language. Examples include GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA.

## N

**Nav2**: The ROS 2 navigation stack for mobile robots. Provides path planning, obstacle avoidance, and localization capabilities.

**Node (ROS 2)**: A process in ROS 2 that performs computation. Nodes communicate via topics, services, and actions.

## P

**Physical AI**: The intersection of artificial intelligence and embodied systems (robots) that exist in and interact with the physical world. Contrasts with "pure digital" AI that operates only in computational spaces.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: The second generation of ROS, a middleware framework for building distributed robot systems. Provides communication, tools, and libraries for robotics development.

**ros2_control**: A ROS 2 framework for managing robot hardware interfaces, controllers, and real-time control loops.

## S

**SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: An XML format for describing robots, sensors, and environments in Gazebo. More feature-rich than URDF.

**Service (ROS 2)**: A request-response communication pattern in ROS 2. A client sends a request and waits for a response from a server.

**Sim-to-Real Transfer**: The process of training AI models or developing behaviors in simulation and successfully deploying them to physical robots.

## T

**TF2 (Transform Library)**: A ROS 2 library for tracking coordinate frame relationships over time. Essential for robot kinematics and sensor fusion.

**Topic (ROS 2)**: A named communication channel in ROS 2 where nodes publish and subscribe to messages. Uses a publish-subscribe pattern.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for describing robot structure, joints, and links. Used by ROS 2 and Gazebo for robot modeling.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A robotics paradigm that combines computer vision, natural language understanding, and robot action execution. Enables robots to follow natural language commands.

**VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technique that uses camera data to simultaneously build a map of the environment and determine the robot's position within it.
